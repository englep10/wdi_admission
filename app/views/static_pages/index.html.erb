          <p class="left-align light">Being able to close on an airplane once every week would be great but unfortunately is not always possible, during periods of inactivity is where many brokers can separate themselves. My strategies of trying to boost operations include reaching out to other brokers. Often talking to other brokers over the phone can give you insight to the direction of the market. Another tactic I have used is to play to my computer science strength. I have experience with web scrapers, email campaigns and Photoshop. I have managed to collect close to 30,000 aviation email addresses. That has enabled me to advertise Vance & Englesâ€™ inventory and have more control over our public image.
